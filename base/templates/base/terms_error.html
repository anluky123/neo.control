Should a User be in any way dissatisfied with the resolution provided by the Management Team regarding the Dispute or in the event that the parties are unable to resolve the Dispute within fourteen (14) days of legasyfight’s receipt of the User’s written notification, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve the Dispute, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all Disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms (including its formation, performance and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other and/or a User’s use of the Services shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Consumer-Related Disputes Supplementary Procedures of the AAA, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.

The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all Disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. Except for the award of any punitive damages, the arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. This arbitration undertaking is made pursuant to and in connection with a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act at 9 U.S.C. Section 1, et seq. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement. Each party shall bear its own costs in connection with any arbitration proceedings. The parties shall equally share the fees of the arbitration and the arbitrator. The Commercial Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at (800) 778-7879. 17.3.1. Location The parties further agree that arbitration shall be initiated in Suffolk County, Massachusetts and to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Suffolk County, Massachusetts in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

17.3.2. Class Action Waiver

The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. USERS AND legasyfight AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.

17.3.3. Exception – Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court

Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through binding arbitration, either party may bring an action in a state or federal court located in Suffolk County, Massachusetts to protect or enforce intellectual property rights. Intellectual property rights include patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights. Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court located in Suffolk County, Massachusetts for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction. The laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts shall be applied in any litigation proceedings, without regard to principles of conflict of laws. Users further agree to accept service of process by mail.

17.3.4. Other Claims

For any claims, other than litigation of intellectual property rights and claims made in small claims court, that are not subject to arbitration the parties agree that litigation shall be initiated in Suffolk County, Massachusetts and agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Suffolk County, Massachusetts. The parties hereby waive any argument that any such court does not have personal jurisdiction or that the location of Suffolk County, Massachusetts is not appropriate or convenient. The parties further agree to waive any and all rights to trial by jury with respect to any claims. In the event that either party initiates a proceeding involving any claim other than an arbitration in accordance with this Section, or initiates a proceeding involving a claim under this Section other than in Suffolk County, Massachusetts, the other party shall recover all attorneys’ fees and expenses reasonably incurred in enforcing these Terms to arbitrate and the location to which the parties have herein agreed.

17.3.5. 30-Day Right to Opt-Out

YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT-OUT OF THE BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISIONS SET FORTH ABOVE WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT (the “Opt-Out Deadline”).
