        <div class="terms__text-t">
            7.1 All competitions will be governed by these Terms along with any specific rules applicable at the time of the competition’s start. The specific rules for each competition will be available from time to time at the start of that competition. Such rules may be, but are not limited to, any entry fees, the numbers of Users in the competition, duration of the competition, distribution of prizes, etc. When you enter a competition, you acknowledge that you have read and understood in full all the Terms and rules regarding the competitions offered by Neo.Control as stated in the Service.
            <br>
            <br>
            7.2 You affirm that at the time that you entered a competition, you had no knowledge as to the outcome of the respective competition. Entering competitions about which the User has gained access to insider information is not allowed. Where there is a suspicion of a violation of this rule, Neo.Control retains the right to void the competition and refuse to pay out winnings. Neo.Control also retains the right to take any further action to protect its legitimate interests and to comply with other laws and regulations. We retain the right to decline to accept entering any competition without providing any reason.
            <br>
            <br>
            7.3 The list of competitions, their status, and details are available to the User on the Service after login. Any errors or mistakes regarding the details of a competition will not influence its validity. Any entry fee that has been paid cannot be canceled or refunded by the User.
            <br>
            <br>
            7.4 Should a competition for any reason be stopped prematurely, before it finishes as set out by its rules, or before any winnings are distributed, the User will be refunded any entry fee/s paid to that competition.
            <br>
            <br>
            7.5 Neo.Control calculates the available funds, the pending funds, the funds reserved in ongoing competitions as well as the amount of the winnings. Unless proved otherwise, these amounts are considered as final and are deemed to be accurate.
            <br>
            <br>
            7.6 Neo.Control will never question you about the relevance of the competitions you wish to enter and will not be held responsible for the possible mistakes that could have been made when entering such competitions, including mistakes regarding the fee/s of the competitions.
            <br>
            <br>
            7.7 Winnings will be paid into the User Account after the final winning result(s) is/are confirmed. However, Neo.Control reserves the right to set aside any winnings should there be investigations into the result of a competition resulting from a suspicion of undue manipulation, cheating, or criminal activities that may have affected the result of the competition. If the irregularity is confirmed, Neo.Control retains the right to declare void any related winnings as well as entry fees.
            <br>
            <br>
            7.8 Should Neo.Control become aware that a User has entered or participated in competitions using an account other than their own single account, all competitions and results, as well as winnings will be voided.

            <br>
            <br>
            7.9 Communication errors do occasionally happen. Competition results are confirmed only when received on our servers.
            <br>
            <br>
            7.10 Should there be a break in communication after you entered a competition and your entry has been received on our servers, it will still be considered valid. You will be informed that it has been accepted once communication is re-established, at which time the competition may have been settled.
